In case of re-import, the scene will retain the original objects, to which the latest changes from your Figma project will be applied.\n• Added project caching - no need to wait for the project to load on each import if there were no changes in your project. After restarting Unity, the project cache is saved.\n• Fixed issue with assigning non-regular font styles.\n• The 'Custom Prefabs' function has been renamed to 'Design System' and also improved - now the prefabs on the scene are created in the form of prefabs (blue icon), and not in the form of ordinary game objects (gray icon). Added support for nested prefabs.\n• Now you do not need to add a new resolution in the Game tab and set it before importing - this process happens automatically for each imported frame.\n• Added UI manager for easy viewing of frames after import.\n• Added a function to disable sprite compression on import to speed up import.\n• Disabled import of gradients when importing images with MPImage - gradients are imported as sprites, not recreated with an asset, although their colors are carried over and you can enable them.\n• Fixed support for having multiple active FCU asset instances in the scene.\n• Added automatic detection of additional installed assets.\n• The asset code has been completely rewritten, which allows to make technical documentation for it, following which you can make specific changes to the asset that are necessary for your company.\n• Added the ability to move an asset to any project folder.\n• Fixed bugs in localization.\n• Updated manuals.\n• Other minor fixes and improvements."

You must update the asset to version 5.5.0 or higher.\n\nBefore updating the asset, completely remove the \"D.A. Assets\" folder.\n\nFIXED:\n• \"Layout Update\" function;\n• An issue when adding \"D.A. Localizator\" to a project;\n• An OutOfMemoryException error in projects that have individual components with a very large number of child elements (e.g., icons made up of several thousand vectors). This has been fixed, but please don’t create such icons 🙂;\n• A bug in AutoLayout import where paddings could be set to -2147483648;\n• A bug in the object hashing algorithm that caused some identical objects to be considered different during import;\n• Other minor fixes.\n\nUPDATED:\n• The \"Manual for developers\".\n\nCHANGED:\n• Third-party embedded assets such as \"D.A. Gradient,\" \"D.A. Corner Rounder,\" and \"SVGMeshUnity\" have been moved to separate folders.\n• UI of the \"Difference Checker\" window – now you can click on the component name to select it in the Unity hierarchy or open it in Figma (labels \"F\" and \"U\").\n\nREMOVED:\n• Unnecessary Debug.Log."
