In case of re-import, the scene will retain the original objects, to which the latest changes from your Figma project will be applied.\n• Added project caching - no need to wait for the project to load on each import if there were no changes in your project. After restarting Unity, the project cache is saved.\n• Fixed issue with assigning non-regular font styles.\n• The 'Custom Prefabs' function has been renamed to 'Design System' and also improved - now the prefabs on the scene are created in the form of prefabs (blue icon), and not in the form of ordinary game objects (gray icon). Added support for nested prefabs.\n• Now you do not need to add a new resolution in the Game tab and set it before importing - this process happens automatically for each imported frame.\n• Added UI manager for easy viewing of frames after import.\n• Added a function to disable sprite compression on import to speed up import.\n• Disabled import of gradients when importing images with MPImage - gradients are imported as sprites, not recreated with an asset, although their colors are carried over and you can enable them.\n• Fixed support for having multiple active FCU asset instances in the scene.\n• Added automatic detection of additional installed assets.\n• The asset code has been completely rewritten, which allows to make technical documentation for it, following which you can make specific changes to the asset that are necessary for your company.\n• Added the ability to move an asset to any project folder.\n• Fixed bugs in localization.\n• Updated manuals.\n• Other minor fixes and improvements."
